# Surf and Ice Cream
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
I have a passion for surfing and the addiction to ice cream, so I want to open a shop that provides both in Oahu. To get the approval of a serious investor, W. Avy, I needed to ease his worries regarding the weather. The more sun and less rain means better business for the shop! Using my new skills and knowledge of SQL light, Flask, and Python and Pandas I was able to pull data that would solidify W. Avy's decision to invest in this endeavour.
